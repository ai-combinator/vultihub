# Stage 4 — Claim Relayer

## What this stage does

Day 28+. User taps "claim my VULT" in the agent. We pay the gas (the user has no ETH), submit the on-chain claim transaction, watch it confirm, and surface the result back to the user via `/airdrop/status`.

Two invariants must hold:

1. **At most one on-chain claim per user, ever.** Network retries, double-taps, races between threads, restarts mid-submit — none of these can result in two on-chain txs for the same vault.
2. **No claim is forgotten across service restarts.** If we crash after broadcasting but before recording confirmation, the next process must pick up where we left off.

This is the only stage that touches mainnet. It's also where the operator controls live — inside the existing `agent-backend` admin dashboard, for monitoring relayer health and triggering manual rebroadcasts on stuck transactions.

---

## The Day 28+ claim flow

1. User taps "claim" in the agent. App POSTs `/airdrop/claim` with their JWT.
2. Backend validates window, kill switch, eligibility, and "not already claimed."
3. Backend takes a serializing lock on the relayer state singleton, fetches the next nonce, builds + signs + broadcasts the claim tx via the EVM RPC, inserts the `claim_submissions` row, increments the nonce, commits.
4. Backend returns `{tx_hash, status: 'submitted', nonce}` — sub-second response.
5. Background monitor goroutine polls submitted-but-unconfirmed rows every N seconds, asks the RPC for receipts, updates each row to `confirmed` or `failed` as receipts come in.
6. User polls `/airdrop/status`, sees `already_claimed: true` once their tx is `confirmed`.

Concurrency model: claim handlers serialize through `SELECT FOR UPDATE` on the relayer state singleton. ~700 claims × ~1 sec per claim = ~12 min total processing if every winner claims at once. Confirmation runs in parallel in the background, so user-visible latency is just the submission window.

## Auth model

| Surface | Auth |
|---|---|
| `POST /airdrop/claim` | JWT (existing middleware) |
| `GET /admin/*`, `GET /admin/api/airdrop/*`, `POST /admin/api/airdrop/*` | Existing admin login/session/TOTP middleware. Read-only airdrop views require admin access; rebroadcast requires `super_admin` or the equivalent high-risk admin role. All writes audit-log operator, action, old tx hash, new tx hash, nonce, and gas bump. |

Do **not** build a separate Basic Auth `/ops/*` dashboard for this campaign. Airdrop operations belong in the existing admin dashboard so they inherit the same auth, role checks, TOTP, and audit trail used for other production controls.

---

## Endpoints

### `POST /airdrop/claim`

**Purpose:** initiate the on-chain VULT claim for the user identified by the JWT.

**Request:**
```http
POST /airdrop/claim
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```

Empty body. Public key from JWT, recipient + amount from `agent_raffle_winners` lookup. (Recipient + amount are also the source of truth on-chain via the contract's `allowance(recipient)` mapping; the local table is what the relayer reads to build calldata.)

**Response — 200 (fresh submission):**
```json
{
  "tx_hash": "0x...",
  "status": "submitted",
  "nonce": 42,
  "submitted_at": "2026-05-15T18:00:00Z"
}
```

**Response — 200 (already submitted, idempotent retry):**
```json
{
  "tx_hash": "0x...",
  "status": "submitted" | "confirmed",
  "nonce": 42,
  "submitted_at": "2026-05-15T18:00:00Z",
  "confirmed_at": "2026-05-15T18:01:23Z"     // only if confirmed
}
```

**Errors:**

| Status | Body | When |
|---|---|---|
| 401 | (handled by middleware) | Missing or invalid JWT |
| 403 | `{"error":"NOT_CLAIM_ELIGIBLE"}` | User isn't a raffle winner OR hasn't completed ≥ QUEST_THRESHOLD quests |
| 403 | `{"error":"CLAIM_WINDOW_NOT_OPEN"}` | `now() < CLAIM_WINDOW_OPEN_AT` |
| 403 | `{"error":"CLAIM_DISABLED"}` | `CLAIM_ENABLED == false` (operator kill switch) |
| 503 | `{"error":"RPC_UNAVAILABLE"}` | EVM RPC didn't respond or returned a non-revert error |
| 503 | `{"error":"KMS_UNAVAILABLE"}` | KMS Sign API failed (relayer wallet signing) |
| 503 | `{"error":"BROADCAST_REJECTED","detail":"..."}` | RPC accepted the tx but returned a logical error (e.g. nonce already used, insufficient funds). Relayer state may need ops attention; logged at warn for ops dashboards. |

503 errors are transient — client retries.

**Behavior:**

1. Verify JWT → `public_key`.
2. Reject if `now() < CLAIM_WINDOW_OPEN_AT`.
3. Reject if `CLAIM_ENABLED == false`.
4. Compute eligibility (`raffle won AND quests_completed >= QUEST_THRESHOLD`). Reject 403 if not.
5. `BEGIN` Postgres transaction.
6. `SELECT ... FROM agent_relayer_state WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE` — serializes all claim handlers.
7. `SELECT * FROM agent_claim_submissions WHERE public_key = ? AND status IN ('submitted', 'confirmed')`. If a row exists, COMMIT and return it (idempotent retry).
8. `next_nonce = relayer_state.next_nonce`.
9. Fetch `(recipient, amount)` from `agent_raffle_winners WHERE public_key = ?`. (No proof — the contract's allowance mapping is the source of truth on-chain.)
10. Query EVM RPC for current gas estimates: `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` for tip, latest block's `baseFeePerGas` for the base. `maxFeePerGas = 2 * baseFee + tip` (standard padded formula).
11. Build the calldata for `AirdropClaim.claim(recipient)`. Exact ABI from `vultiagent-airdrop`. The `amount` is already locked in the contract's allowance; we record it locally only for display in the status response.
12. Build EIP-1559 tx with `next_nonce`, gas params from step 10, calldata, chain ID from `EVM_CHAIN_ID`.
13. Sign the tx via AWS KMS `Sign` with `KMS_RELAYER_KEY_ARN`. Convert returned DER signature to EVM `(r, s, v)` and assemble the signed tx bytes.
14. Broadcast via RPC (`eth_sendRawTransaction`).
15. INSERT `agent_claim_submissions` row with `nonce, recipient, amount, tx_hash, status='submitted', submitted_at=NOW(), max_fee_gwei, max_priority_fee_gwei`.
16. UPDATE `agent_relayer_state SET next_nonce = next_nonce + 1`.
17. COMMIT.
18. Return `{tx_hash, status, nonce, submitted_at}`.

If any of steps 9–14 fail, ROLLBACK. The state row's `next_nonce` is unchanged, no `claim_submissions` row is inserted, and the user can retry. The client receives the appropriate 5xx error.

The eligibility check in step 4 calls the shared `eligibility.go` helper from Stage 3 (in-process Go function call, not an HTTP roundtrip — eligibility is a pure DB read with no signing or external calls, so the API-endpoint pattern doesn't apply).

There is no `/internal/relayer/*` route group just to feed UI pages. Balance and stuck-claims health are exposed through the admin API and backed by in-process relayer service calls. The data shapes are documented in the Operator interface section below.

---

## Admin dashboard operator controls

Add an Airdrop section to the existing `agent-backend` admin dashboard. Reuse the current admin static app and admin API patterns; do not introduce a separate UI stack, Basic Auth island, or `/ops` route group.

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /admin` | Existing admin dashboard. Add an Airdrop/Relayer section or nav item. |
| `GET /admin/api/airdrop/relayer/balance` | Returns relayer health for display: `relayer_address`, `eth_balance_wei`/`_human`, `vult_contract_balance_wei`/`_human`, `low_balance_warning`, `low_balance_threshold_eth`, `estimated_claims_remaining`, `next_nonce`, `rpc_block_height`. `estimated_claims_remaining = floor(eth_balance / (avg_gas_per_claim * current_gas_price))`. `low_balance_warning = true` when `eth_balance < LOW_BALANCE_THRESHOLD_ETH`. |
| `GET /admin/api/airdrop/relayer/stuck-claims?older_than_minutes=N` | Returns submitted-but-unconfirmed claims older than the threshold (default 10), sorted by minutes-pending descending. Each row includes `public_key` (redacted to first 8 chars in the UI), `tx_hash`, `nonce`, `submitted_at`, `minutes_pending`, `max_fee_gwei`, `max_priority_fee_gwei`. Empty list is the healthy state. |
| `POST /admin/api/airdrop/relayer/rebroadcast` | High-risk admin action. Reads `{public_key, bump_gwei}` (default 50). Calls the rebroadcast service in-process: sign new EIP-1559 tx with **same nonce** + bumped fees, broadcast, update `tx_hash` + gas fields on the row. Returns 404 if no row, 400 if already confirmed, 503 if RPC failed. The old tx and new tx race in the mempool — both share the same nonce so only one can confirm. |

Admin handlers query the DB + RPC through the relayer service — no internal HTTP roundtrip.

Implement the server handlers in the existing admin package and extend the existing admin static assets. Reuse the admin audit logger for rebroadcast attempts and results.

## Background workers

### Confirmation monitor

A single goroutine started at service boot. Loop:

1. `SELECT * FROM agent_claim_submissions WHERE status = 'submitted' ORDER BY submitted_at LIMIT 100`.
2. For each row, call `eth_getTransactionReceipt(tx_hash)` via the RPC.
3. If receipt present and `status = 1` (success) and `blockNumber` is at least `latestBlock - CONFIRMATION_BLOCKS` (default 1, set higher for paranoid safety) blocks back: UPDATE row to `status='confirmed', confirmed_at=NOW(), block_number=...`.
4. If receipt present and `status = 0` (revert): UPDATE to `status='failed', failed_at=NOW(), failure_reason='reverted'`. (Operator inspects via Etherscan.)
5. If no receipt: skip — try again next tick.
6. Sleep `CONFIRMATION_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 15).

On startup, the monitor immediately runs once to pick up any rows still in `submitted` from before a restart — guarantees no claim is forgotten.

Lives in `cmd/scheduler/` alongside the existing `agent_scheduled_tasks` poller (reuses the existing scheduler binary; no new process).

## Schema

```sql
CREATE TYPE airdrop_claim_status AS ENUM ('submitted', 'confirmed', 'failed');

CREATE TABLE agent_claim_submissions (
    public_key            TEXT                   NOT NULL,
    nonce                 BIGINT                 NOT NULL UNIQUE,                 -- one nonce, one row, ever
    recipient             TEXT                   NOT NULL,
    amount                NUMERIC(78, 0)         NOT NULL,
    tx_hash               TEXT                   NOT NULL,                          -- updated in place on rebroadcast
    status                airdrop_claim_status   NOT NULL,
    max_fee_gwei          INTEGER                NOT NULL,
    max_priority_fee_gwei INTEGER                NOT NULL,
    block_number          BIGINT,                                                 -- non-null once confirmed
    failure_reason        TEXT,                                                   -- non-null when status='failed'
    submitted_at          TIMESTAMPTZ            NOT NULL,
    confirmed_at          TIMESTAMPTZ,
    failed_at             TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- "at most one in-flight or completed claim per user"
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_claim_submissions_one_per_user
  ON agent_claim_submissions (public_key)
  WHERE status IN ('submitted', 'confirmed');

-- Confirmation monitor scan
CREATE INDEX idx_claim_submissions_pending
  ON agent_claim_submissions (submitted_at)
  WHERE status = 'submitted';

-- Relayer wallet nonce + general state
CREATE TABLE agent_relayer_state (
    id           INT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 1 CHECK (id = 1),                       -- singleton
    next_nonce   BIGINT,                                                         -- NULL until first boot reads it from the chain
    last_synced  TIMESTAMPTZ     NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

INSERT INTO agent_relayer_state (id) VALUES (1);                                 -- next_nonce auto-populated on first boot
```

On service boot, if `next_nonce` is NULL the relayer queries `eth_getTransactionCount(relayer_address, 'pending')` and writes the result inside a `SELECT FOR UPDATE` transaction. Subsequent boots no-op. Removes the manual `psql UPDATE` that would otherwise be a Day 28 footgun.

`nonce UNIQUE` is the database-level guard against accidental nonce reuse (anywhere — across all users). The partial unique index on `(public_key)` enforces the "one claim per user" invariant. The `(submitted_at) WHERE status='submitted'` partial index makes the monitor's scan O(unconfirmed) rather than O(all_claims).

Rebroadcasts update `tx_hash` in place. Audit trail of prior bumps lives in the structured logs (one log line per rebroadcast tagged with old `tx_hash`, new `tx_hash`, bump amount, operator). Etherscan covers the public chain side. The previous-array column was dropped 2026-04-23 — ops debug from logs instead.

## Configuration

| Var | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `KMS_RELAYER_KEY_ARN` | AWS ARN | KMS key signing claim txs (the relayer wallet). Stage 0 procurement. **Single KMS key for the whole airdrop** — no separate quest oracle key. |
| `EVM_RPC_URL` | URL | Ethereum mainnet RPC. Free public endpoint (PublicNode, llamarpc) is acceptable per the eng-side decision. |
| `EVM_CHAIN_ID` | int | 1 for mainnet. |
| `AIRDROP_CLAIM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` | 0x-address | Same value as Stage 3's `verifyingContract`. |
| `CLAIM_WINDOW_OPEN_AT` | RFC3339 timestamp | Day 28 wall clock; before this, `/airdrop/claim` returns 403. |
| `CLAIM_ENABLED` | bool, default true | Operator kill switch. Read on every request — hot-reload by env-var change + service signal, or a redeploy. |
| `LOW_BALANCE_THRESHOLD_ETH` | decimal, default 0.5 | Triggers `low_balance_warning: true` in the admin relayer balance view. |
| `CONFIRMATION_BLOCKS` | int, default 1 | Required reorg depth before marking a tx `confirmed`. |
| `CONFIRMATION_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | int, default 15 | How often the monitor checks for receipts. |
| `INTERNAL_API_KEY` | string secret | (Reused from Stage 3.) `X-Internal-Token` header value. |

`OPS_USERNAME` and `OPS_PASSWORD` are not Stage 4 config. They belonged to the superseded Basic Auth `/ops/*` dashboard design and should not be present in target prod envs or sample env files.

## Observability

Prometheus metrics:

| Metric | Type | Labels |
|---|---|---|
| `airdrop_claim_request_total` | Counter | `result` ∈ `{submitted, idempotent_retry, not_eligible, window_not_open, disabled, rpc_error, kms_error, broadcast_rejected}` |
| `airdrop_claim_submit_duration_seconds` | Histogram | (handler latency end-to-end) |
| `airdrop_claim_kms_sign_duration_seconds` | Histogram | (KMS Sign call only) |
| `airdrop_claim_broadcast_duration_seconds` | Histogram | (`eth_sendRawTransaction` only) |
| `airdrop_claim_confirmation_total` | Counter | `result` ∈ `{confirmed, reverted, monitor_skipped}` |
| `airdrop_claim_confirmation_lag_seconds` | Histogram | (time from `submitted_at` to `confirmed_at`) |
| `airdrop_relayer_eth_balance_wei` | Gauge | (refreshed by the monitor on each pass) |
| `airdrop_relayer_next_nonce` | Gauge | |
| `airdrop_relayer_rebroadcast_total` | Counter | |

Structured logs include: `public_key` (first 8 chars), `nonce`, `tx_hash`, `request_id`, `result`. KMS errors and broadcast errors carry the underlying error message.

A Prometheus alert on `airdrop_relayer_eth_balance_wei < 0.5e18` pages ops.

## Tests

**Unit:**
- Claim eligibility: every combination of (winner / not winner) × (quests met / not met) × (already claimed / not).
- Window enforcement: before, exactly at, after `CLAIM_WINDOW_OPEN_AT`.
- Kill switch: `CLAIM_ENABLED=false` returns `403 CLAIM_DISABLED`.
- Idempotency: two concurrent calls (simulated via mock `FOR UPDATE` serialization) — one inserts, the other returns the inserted row's `tx_hash`.
- Rebroadcast: existing row is updated in place (new `tx_hash`, bumped fees), nonce unchanged.
- KMS DER → EVM signature: golden test against a known-good signature.

**Integration (real Postgres + LocalStack KMS + Anvil mainnet fork):**
- Full path: synthetic raffle-winners row + on-chain `setWinners` call to Anvil → quest fixtures making user eligible → POST /airdrop/claim → tx confirms on Anvil → confirmation monitor flips status → next status request shows `already_claimed: true`.
- Restart-safety: kill the service after the broadcast UPDATE but before… (well, the broadcast and UPDATE are in one txn, so there's no in-between state). Test instead: kill the service immediately after broadcast (one tx in `submitted` state in DB), restart, observe monitor pick up the submitted row on its first tick and confirm against Anvil.
- Concurrency: 50 concurrent /airdrop/claim calls for 50 distinct eligible users → 50 distinct nonces, 50 distinct tx hashes, no DB constraint violations, all submitted within ~50 seconds.
- Concurrency: 50 concurrent /airdrop/claim calls for the same user → exactly one tx submitted, 49 idempotent-retry responses with the same tx_hash.
- Stuck-tx flow: tx broadcast at low gas → never confirms → admin stuck-claims view lists it → admin rebroadcast action with bump → new tx confirms → original is dropped (same nonce).
- Balance endpoint returns expected values; low-balance threshold flips the warning.

**End-to-end (with `vultiagent-airdrop`):**
- Multisig calls `setWinners` on Foundry-deployed `AirdropClaim.sol` → claim submitted by Stage 4's relayer against the same contract → contract pays VULT to recipient.

## Open dependencies

- **Stage 0 — `KMS_RELAYER_KEY_ARN` provisioned, relayer wallet funded with ETH.** Without ETH at the relayer address, every claim 503s.
- **Stage 0 — `AIRDROP_CLAIM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` known.** From the contract mission's mainnet deploy.
- **Stage 0 — `CLAIM_WINDOW_OPEN_AT` decision locked.**
- **Stage 0 — VULT prize pool funded into `AirdropClaim.sol`.** Without VULT in the contract, claims revert.
- **`vultisig/vultiagent-airdrop` — `AirdropClaim.sol` deployed to mainnet** with the claim function ABI matching what we encode in step 12 of the claim flow. Tracked at [vultisig/vultiagent-airdrop#1](https://github.com/vultisig/vultiagent-airdrop/issues/1).
- **Stage 2 — `agent_raffle_winners` populated.** Pre-condition for the claim handler's recipient/amount lookup.
- **Multisig has called `setWinners(...)` on the contract** for every row in `agent_raffle_winners` before Day 28. Without this, every claim reverts on the contract's `amount == 0` check. Stage 2's `verify-onchain` subcommand is the gate that confirms this.
- **Stage 3 — `eligibility.go` shared helper available.** Called inline from the claim handler.
- **EVM RPC chosen** — free public endpoint is acceptable per eng-lead decision.
- **EVM RPC reachable from the relayer at boot** — needed for the auto nonce-sync on first boot.

## Done when

- `/airdrop/claim` returns documented shapes against documented status codes.
- DB unique partial index enforces "one claim per user" — concurrency test passes (50 concurrent same-user requests yield exactly one tx).
- 50 concurrent distinct-user requests submit all 50 in ~serialised order, all with distinct nonces.
- Confirmation monitor flips `submitted` → `confirmed` against Anvil within seconds of the receipt landing.
- Restart test: kill mid-pipeline, restart, observe monitor pick up unfinished work.
- Rebroadcast endpoint succeeds with bumped gas; original tx is replaced by the new one.
- Admin relayer balance API returns sane values; low-balance flag flips at the configured threshold.
- Admin stuck-claims API lists pending-too-long rows; empty when none.
- Existing admin dashboard renders the Airdrop/Relayer controls. Read-only views are admin-gated; rebroadcast is high-risk-role-gated and audit-logged.
- E2E test against Foundry-deployed `AirdropClaim.sol` passes start-to-finish: register → win raffle → multisig calls setWinners → complete quests → claim → VULT received at recipient.
- Day 28 runbook drafted (`docs/runbooks/relayer-day-28.md`) covering: deploy steps, smoke test, kill switch flip-on. (No manual nonce sync step — that auto-runs on first boot.)
- Stuck-tx runbook drafted covering: how to read the admin stuck-claims view, decide bump amount, handle "still stuck after rebroadcast" case (probably a free RPC throttling issue → switch RPC URL or pay for one).
- Top-up runbook drafted (`docs/runbooks/relayer-top-up.md`): when `low_balance_warning` fires (or alert fires below 0.5 ETH), the funding multisig sends ETH to the relayer address (visible in the admin relayer balance view). Standard EOA send, no contract interaction. Safe to do mid-campaign at any time; no service restart needed. The relayer wallet is fundable from any wallet — there's no allow-list on the receive side.
- End-of-campaign runbook drafted (`docs/runbooks/relayer-end-of-campaign.md`): once the claim window has decisively closed (e.g. 90 days past `CLAIM_WINDOW_OPEN_AT` with no recent claims), the multisig flips `CLAIM_ENABLED=false` (kill switch — every claim immediately 403s with `CLAIM_DISABLED`), then calls `recoverERC20(VULT, balance, treasuryAddress)` on the contract to drain the unclaimed VULT back to treasury, then optionally calls `recoverERC20` on the relayer wallet's remaining ETH (sent from the relayer via a one-off KMS-signed tx, or just left to fund a future campaign). Document the multisig signers' steps and which etherscan calls to watch.
